# Sandbox

NOTICE: (DEPRECATED) The sandbox was last updated on April 2019 and doesn't contain many of the recent changes made to opensolar/openx.

Sandbox contains static data that is used to simulate an investing environment. This can be used to present openx in conferences or to your friends without having to worry about creating projects and populating them with stablecoin and XLM each time. The sandbox requires about 10 minutes to populate and can be run with the help of the `-t` flag.
