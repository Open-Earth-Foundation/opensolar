This microgrid project, developed in collaboration with Rwandan Green Fund (FONERWA), Yale and MIT, aims to serve 250 homes, including its only school, â€˜Sunshine Garden,' the town infirmary led by a team of doctors without borders, and the town hall. The school principal has taken the role of originator and convened the community in 5 occasions. The agreed form of development is through a community-owned cooperative Village Energy Collective' which is in early stages of incorporation and listing on the Rwanda Stock Exchange. The Rwandan Green Fund has agreed to place 20% of the total investment in a first-loss escrow, they are expected to formally sign when the project achieves stage 2. The current raise has a cap of $5000 to cover due diligence, pre-feasibility engineering, legal costs and technical request for proposal from solar developers. Early investors will have a premium on the stock value ratio. Potential risks of the project not advancing past stage 3 include tariff disagreements between offtakers, and a dispute on a land strip where one array will be located. "
