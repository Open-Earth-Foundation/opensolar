  name: "Pasto Public School - POC 1 kW"
  city: "Aibonito"
  state: "Puerto Rico"
  country: "USA"
  project type: "Grant"
  originator name: "Martin Wainstein"
  description: "The public school of SU Pasto is a Montessori-based school located in the town of Aibonito, Puerto Rico and operated by the Instituto Nueva Escuela. After hurricanes Maria and Irma affected the island of Puerto Rico, the school was out of power for over 6 months. However, it operated as a defacto community shelter since its Parent-Teacher Association is a strong cohesive group in the Aibonito community. The school had an emergency generator and was able to cater to community needs during the aftermath. The most important aspect missing for the school was a resilient telecommunication system to connect with first responders.The current project entails the installation of a 1kW system connected to the administrative building’s subpanel. The solar system powers critical loads in the admin building, including emergency lights, a telecommunication system, the principal's computer and a mini fridge for first aids. The project is a proof-of-concept installation design and developed by the Yale Openlab and the DCI at the MIT Media Lab. The object is to test the interconnection of the system and the internet connected sensors powering simulated payment mechanisms."

    design description: "The installation was performed over the administration building where the principal office and the representative of the Department of Education sit.. The school has 14 buildings connected to a 300kW substation. The solar system is expected to cover 20% of the admin building for critical loads only. "

    installation archetype: "This is a model installation in that the solar and battery support only a subpanel of the building circuitry, where only critical loads have been connected. The system is configured as a grid-tied installation, in that the main grid can also support other loads in the panel, and can also be used to power the battery bank. The installation allows for the interconnection of an emergency generator but it is currently not permanently linked to the system. The system size can be expanded from 1 kW up to 5kW to cover a greater % of the building load."
    it infrastructure: "Different layers of IoT energy monitoring devices informs of the energy generated by the solar system and the energy consumed by the end-user. This energy data that will eventually use an intermediary oracle, activates payment transactions per kWh at a specified tariff rate and at specific intervals. Energy payment transactions occur between the end-users wallet/account and a main escrow smart contract that accrues the funds and issues payment of interests (i.e. coupons) to investors. Once the accrued funds can cover the original principle, the contracts pays off investors and the bonds matures."

      - "The MIT and Yale team convened a meeting with the Parent-Teacher Organisation, led by principal Janice Alejandro. Over 50 members of the community gathered to discuss the project, with unanimous approval and significant interest for its replication."
    participation:
      - "https://openx-images.s3.amazonaws.com/demo/pasto-page-participation.png"
      - "The principal, deputy principal, janitor, two teachers and one parent have volunteered as caretakers of the system to monitor its status, report any qualitative information and coordinate with the operation & maintenance required. "
    outreach:
      - "https://openx-images.s3.amazonaws.com/demo/pasto-page-outreach.png"
      - "The system has been installed with instructions so that it can act as a pedagogical site for students to learn about the merits of solar energy, electricity and basic electronics. Talk about solar energy will be given every semester in the context of climate change communication to the community."
    governance:
      - "https://openx-images.s3.amazonaws.com/demo/pasto-page-governance.png"
      - "The board of the Parent-Teacher Organisation, composed of 5 chairs, will coordinate with the director of the Yale Openlab and the head of strategy at the MIT DCI to define any governance steps that the system requires."
