  opportunity:
    description: "The project has financed a 10 kW community solar project for a New Haven Homeless Shelter, and will provide returns through a long-term contract to sell discounted electricity to the building. Additionally, future revenue may be generated through the sale of the project, or through selling renewable energy credits from the clean energy generated by the solar array. Buying stock in this proejct company gives you an ownership stake in a community solar array with contracted cash flows for 20 years. Put your money to work making the world a better place. This investment will influence positive change in the lives of low-income residents through reduced utility bills, produce environmental and social impacts, and demonstrate  alternative investment pathways to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy. Renewable energy infrastructure is only going to grow in coming years. An estimated one trillion dollars of investment in renewable infrastructure is needed every year to achieve the goals set forth in the Paris Agreement on climate change."
    pilot goals:
      - "Until recently, only people with access to a lot of money could own and earn money from solar projects. NHCS offers the opportunity to benefit from solar to everyday people, while also bringing benefits to people in the community."
      - "There are significant environmental and social benefits to investing in this project."

    design description: "New Haven Shelter Solar is a 10 kW community solar project located on Battel Street in New Haven, Connecticut. The lot on Battel Street is the site of the annual Jim Vlock First Year Building Project – a partnership between the Yale School of Architecture and Columbia House. Columbia House is a nonprofit organization based in New Haven that serves people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless by providing shelter and housing and by fostering their personal growth and independence. This project structure a predictable set of future cash flows for investors and provide Columbia House access to low-cost electricity to further their mission."
    description: "This 10 kW system was installed in a Grid-Tied design by CT solar Developers. It has a 15 kW smart solarEdge inverter, and an Itron revenue grade REC meter. The system is roof-mounted on a 55 degree angle on a SE facing view. However, its high efficient Jingko panels provide a 78% efficiency rating."

      - "This project provides CNH Homeless Shelter access to low-cost electricity to further their mission. We believe this project will result in inexpensive power being provided to lower income residents in a state with one of the highest energy costs in the United States. In addition to providing environmental benefits, this project frees up much needed income for its beneficiaries. In a society where income is the greatest social determinant of health, we believe that this project will have significant health-oriented cobenefits as well. We will document environmental, social and financial impacts carefully to steward your investment with the utmost integrity and transparency."
